# Electron-examples
An example program made in electron in preparation for my Scheduling program.


The examples will serve as ways for me to improve the structure of my javascript, making it easier for me to make reliable and reusable code when i actually start working on the scheduling app.

- **Version 1**

  When run, the user can add Items to the shoppping list but cannot remove them. The only way to do so being to delete them in items.JSON
